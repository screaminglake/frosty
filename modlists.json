    "description": "Stay FROSTy is an experience entirely based around attempting to provide a complete and stable FROST experience.  For those that have never heard of it, FROST Survival Simulator is a hardcore total conversion mod for Fallout 4 that overhauls literally every aspect of the game to play like something else entirely.  As a survival simulator, survival is the goal and several difficult gameplay mechanics are implemented to make that exceptionally difficult.

For those looking for a complete and comprehensive FROST experience out of the box, this is it.",
